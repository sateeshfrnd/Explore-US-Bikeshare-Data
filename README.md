### Explore US Bikeshare Data 
This is a part of Udacity Nanodegree Program that to explore the US Bikeshare Data from three major U.S. cities - Chicago, Washington, and New York City and get the information as most frequent time for travel, most commonly used stations, different types of users and gender wise travel counts.

This project focuses on usage of Python's modules- Pandas and Numpy.Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user choose the data and filter for a dataset to analyse.

### Files used
- Three csv files that having data of three cities :
   - chicago.csv
   - new_york_city.csv
   - washington.csv

### Data Dictionary
- All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
   - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
   - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
   - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
   - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
   - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
   - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
   
- The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
   - Gender
   - Birth Year
   
### Calculate Statistics
Code is written to calculate the following information:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
   - most common month
   - most common day of week
   - most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip
   - most common start station
   - most common end station
   - most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration
   - total travel time
   - average travel time

4. User info
   - counts of each user type
   - counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
   - earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
